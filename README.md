# Crappy GBA emulator

If you came here looking for an emulator to download, prepare to be disappointed.

This is not a good emulator, I'll say that much. Contain within you will find such stupidity as:

- Using large match statements to define per-cycle behaviour of an instruction instead of doing in a more logical manner
- Random statements which make no sense but are there for no reason
- And many other stupid pieces of code

Needless to say, this is my first 'real' rust project, can you tell?

Additionally, I have many goals for this emulator:
- Getting it working

Which will be a challenge given how inefficient my current program most likely is (not to mention my lack of any formal education on the subject).

Anyway, I don't really care what you do with this. But please, for the love of god, don't use my emulator.
